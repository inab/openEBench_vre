Welcome to the virtual research environment (VRE)!

This is your first dummy file of your personal user workspace. Here, you'll find listed your uploaded data and your execution results. 

To start playing, just import data clicking on the "Get Data" section in the left-hand menu. And once imported, select the desired community workflow by clicking the grey wrench icon that has appeared next to the newly imported file name.

Learn more about these operations and other VRE functionalities consulting the "Help" section in the left-hand menu.

Welcome again!
